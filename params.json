Mobile phones, or cell phones became 'smart phones' (not that I like the name but then again its what it is called) and always on internet is becoming a reality albeit slowly.\r\nOver years lot of technologies were put on rack for better use (xml with css for example) at a better time, now that its time to get our mechine to mechine connections, I think it is appropriate time to dust out the old files and bring them out.\r\n### WHY A DASH BOARD\r\nIt all began with my little single board computer, I had been playing with it for some time and I created internet radios, and then some sensors et cetra. I realised I am treating it like any other web based software, so much to say most pf the tutorials around it shows you how to connect to OPEN AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS but you need atleast one time acces to a browser.\r\nThat is where your yours truly came in with this project; for a lack of better name it is piot (π iot)\r\n### SOME COMMANDMENTS\r\n* Never should a user need to use a browser on the devices\r\n** The devices should auto register\r\n** the devices should auto update\r\n* AUTO CONFIGURE\r\n**The devices shall auto configure the dash boards\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
