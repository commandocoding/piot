<p>A dashboard for Internet of Things, with IOT first approach.</p>

<p>The internet of things as a vision has been around for some time now, starting from science fictions and cinema its slowly coming into the domain of daily human life. Mobile phones, or cell phones became 'smart phones' (not that I like the name but then again its what it is called) and always on internet is becoming a reality albeit slowly.
Over years lot of technologies were put on rack for better use (xml with css for example) at a better time, now that its time to get our mechine to mechine connections, I think it is appropriate time to dust out the old files and bring them out.</p>

<a id="why-a-dash-board" class="anchor" href="#why-a-dash-board" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHY A DASH BOARD</h3>

<p>It all began with my little single board computer, I had been playing with it for some time and I created internet radios, and then some sensors et cetra. I realised I am treating it like any other web based software, so much to say most pf the tutorials around it shows you how to connect to OPEN AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS but you need atleast one time acces to a browser.
That is where your yours truly came in with this project; for a lack of better name it is piot (π iot)</p>

<a id="some-commandments" class="anchor" href="#some-commandments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SOME COMMANDMENTS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Never should a user need to use a browser on the devices
** The devices should auto register
** the devices should auto update</li>
<li>AUTO CONFIGURE
**The devices shall auto configure the dash boards</li>
</ul>
